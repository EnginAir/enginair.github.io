This website is designed to showcase EnginAir, a Northern Arizona University Computer Science Capstone project.  Our project spans the 2019-2020 school year and covers design and requirements acquisition as well an product implementaion. 

## Introduction
In 1903, the Wright Brothers made history by building and flying the first successful powered airplane.  This event propelled us into the aerial age and since then, airplanes have become the most commonly used mode of transportation, in the US, for long distances.  Aviation and propulsion systems have greatly improved resulting in the aircrafts we have today.  Many propulsion engines are available, but gas turbines, specifically, auxiliary power units (APUs) are superior since they provide energy for aircraft functions other than just propulsion.  These engines require periodic maintenance and are reported to the mechanics and engineers via a diagnostic report.  Proper upkeep is important to prevent maintenance delays and keeps the engine functioning properly to ensure a safe flight.  Our project, sponsored by Honeywell, aims to make this diagnostic report process more efficient by ensuring WiFi access points for operators to upload their reports to a cloud database.

## Sponsor: Honeywell
Our project is sponsored by Honeywell who is the largest producer of gas turbine APUs with over 100,000 produced and over 36,000 still in service today.  Our client, Harlan Mitchell, is a Systems Technical Manager and works for the HTF7K Controls Systems Integration Unit.  His team is responsible for all aspects of the engine control unit including the the Engine Control Unit (ECU). 

## Project: Connected Engine Data System Administrative Portal
The team is currently working to create a robust system that dynamically and visually represents WiFi signals everytime a Honeywell operated engines lands at an airport. This concept will, in theory, help Honeywell keep track of the locations that airplanes land to give pilots and engineers an idea as to where the plane can get the best WiFI signal to upload critical maintainence logs to ensure safe flights across the world.

## Team Information: EnginAir
Our team is comprised of five seniors majoring in Computer Science. 
<need to include team members -- don't know how you want to format this (i.e. pictures, names, etc.)>

Our team also consists of one graduate school mentor.

## Updates as of - Oct. 14, 2019
EnginAir landing page is completed for the most part.  Some minor changes may occur.

This website is still under construction and you may notice minor and/or major changes on future visits.
