EnginAir Home Page

## Contributing
To test locally, you can run `gem install bundler` to install bundler. Then run `bundle install`, then `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
This will spin up a local test page, which you can see if the page actually works correctly.

You can check the build status on Travis to see if your code builds correctly.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EnginAir/enginair.github.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/EnginAir/enginair.github.io)

To test your code before deploying, make a pull request into the `staging` branch. When this is pushed, it will get deployed
to the [![staging site]](https://cefns.nau.edu/~ieo2/test_site/). Please note that links and page layout may not look correct
if it is vastly different than what is on the production site.
